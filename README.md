# Alive5v5
Alive5v5 is a CS:GO SourceMod plugin used by me and my mates to create custom 5v5 (10 man) competitive games, similar to those on FACEIT or PopFlash.
It was created for this purpose and this purpose only. Slowly, more and more features will be added in order to prepare for a general-purpose launch.

## Features

 * 10-man ready requirement: everyone needs to be !ready in order to start a game.
 * Team Leaders: each team has a Leader that decides which side they prefer.
 * Knife Round: first round in each match is a knife round that decides which team Leader gets to choose what side their team play on.
 * more features will be eventually added.
